# Advanced Haptics

A Flutter plugin for playing powerful, custom haptic feedback patterns. This package provides a unified API for Android and iOS, giving developers access to fine-grained vibration control and Apple Core Haptics `.ahap` files.

## ‚ú® Features

-   ‚úÖ **Unified API**: A single, easy-to-use Dart API for both platforms.
-   üéØ **Custom Waveforms**: Full control of vibration timing, intensity, and looping.
-   üçé **Core Haptics on iOS**: Play custom `.ahap` files and control the player state.
-   üß† **Predefined Patterns**: A suite of built-in methods like `lightTap()`, `success()`, `error()` and more.
-   üß© **Native Android Effects**: Access system-level vibration effects like `tick`, `heavyClick`, etc.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Capability Detection**: Easily check if a device supports advanced haptics.
-   ü™∂ **Graceful Fallbacks**: Sensible defaults for unsupported hardware or platforms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

*(This section remains the same as it covers initial setup for both platforms)*

### 1. Install

Add `advanced_haptics` to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  advanced_haptics: ^0.0.7 # Use the latest version
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.

### 2. Android Setup

Add the `VIBRATE` permission to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <!-- Add this line -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
    <application ...>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### 3. iOS Setup

To play custom patterns on iOS, add your `.ahap` files to your project assets (e.g., under an `assets/haptics/` folder) and declare the folder in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/haptics/
```

---

## üì¶ Usage

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:advanced_haptics/advanced_haptics.dart';
```

### General & Cross-Platform Methods

These methods are designed to work on both Android and iOS, with graceful fallbacks where necessary.

#### ‚úÖ Capability Check

```dart
final bool hasSupport = await AdvancedHaptics.hasCustomHapticsSupport();
if (hasSupport) {
  // Safe to use advanced haptics
}
```

#### ‚ö° Predefined Patterns

Use these for quick, consistent feedback across your app.

```dart
await AdvancedHaptics.lightTap();
await AdvancedHaptics.mediumTap();
await AdvancedHaptics.heavyRumble();
await AdvancedHaptics.success();
await AdvancedHaptics.error();
```

#### üõë Stop All Vibrations

Immediately cancels any ongoing haptic effect on either platform.

```dart
await AdvancedHaptics.stop();
```

---

### Platform-Specific Features

These methods expose powerful, native-only features. Check for platform or use `hasCustomHapticsSupport()` before calling.

### ü§ñ Android Specific

#### Custom Waveform (Android Preferred)

Design unique patterns with precise control over timings (in milliseconds), amplitudes (0-255), and an optional repeat index. While this is emulated on iOS, it provides the most granular control on Android.

```dart
// Plays a pattern, with no repeat
await AdvancedHaptics.playWaveform(
  [0, 100, 100, 200],     // Timings: [delay, on, off, on]
  [0, 180, 0, 255],       // Amplitudes for each segment
  repeat: -1              // -1 means no repeat
);
```

#### Native Android Effects (API 29+)

Play Android's built-in system haptic effects using an enum. This has no effect on iOS.

```dart
await AdvancedHaptics.playPredefined(AndroidPredefinedHaptic.tick);
```
*Available enums: `click`, `doubleClick`, `tick`, `heavyClick`, `pop`, `thud`, `ringtone1`.*

---

### üçé iOS Specific

#### Play `.ahap` File

Trigger your custom-designed haptic experiences on supported iPhones. This is the highest-fidelity way to play haptics on iOS.

```dart
await AdvancedHaptics.playAhap('assets/haptics/success.ahap');
```

#### Haptic Player Controls

These methods control the state of the active `CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer` on iOS, which is typically started by `playAhap` or `playWaveform`. They have no effect on Android.

```dart
// Pause the currently playing haptic pattern
await AdvancedHaptics.pause();

// Resume a paused pattern
await AdvancedHaptics.resume();

// Jump to 0.5 seconds into the pattern
await AdvancedHaptics.seek(offset: 0.5);

// Cancel all scheduled events and stop immediately
await AdvancedHaptics.cancel();
```
